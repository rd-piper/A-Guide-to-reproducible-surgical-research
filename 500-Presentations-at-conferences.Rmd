# Presentations at conferences

## Poster presentations

<!-- Julian could you tell me why poster presentations are so important -->
Posters are a very important form of presentation at conferences and nearly all researchers will present them at some time.
The following are important considerations for poster preparation and presenting. 

<!-- What is a conference paper -->
A conference poster is typically a large sheet of card, plastic laminate or other stiff medium on which is printed details and images describing a study and its outcomes. 
<!-- test -->
It is displayed pinned-up at designated sessions, typically with an author present, and is accessible for conference attendees to scrutinise at leisure. 
It uses a similar structure to a research manuscript, i.e., title, authors, abstract, introductory review, methods detail, data and conclusions, but has to be extremely abbreviated. 
It has a lower status than an oral presentation but is an excellent way to communicate with many advantages over a short talk, in particular, it is less ephemeral and allows in-depth discussion in front of the printed-out details. 
Posters are ideal for attendees walking around to scan rapidly to find content of interest, especially for those less confident in English.  

Personal discussions in front of posters can be pivotal in forming professional connections, and to engage with detailed criticism of the work. 
Like oral presentations, posters are often the prelude to full journal publication, but may simply be used to get expert feedback. 
As a learning exercise it is good to read some posters and assess how easy or hard it is to follow the work; however, note that posters, like talks, are an exercise inefficient communication, not in perfection.

### Poster (or presentation) abstracts

These are submitted according to instructions long before the conference. 
They resemble in form a manuscript abstract, standing self-contained without further information. Phrases like “these outcomes will be discussed…” are frowned on. 
A committee will assess abstracts, with the highest-scoring ones selected for oral presenting, the rest as posters. 
This does not always reflect the quality of the work.

### The three main types of poster viewers

Many conference attendees will have no strong interest in the subject of your poster and will walk past scanning the title and any striking images. 
Most people do not have the time to look at posters outside their own areas unless the conference is small. 
Attracting a general audience means the poster needs a short and informative title, minimal text and good figures (and nice images) that tell a clear story. 

The second group of viewers are those with an interest in your area of work – they will take time to read summaries, introductions and figures, but ignore fine details. 
They should come away from your poster with a good idea of the study and the data. 

The third group have strong interest in your area and in what you have done so will take time to read everything, including methods and references that others will not bother with. 
They will mind less about small fonts with long sentences as they are motivated to read it. If you are there they will usually ask you to explain the work to them and ask questions. 
Note this group includes poster award judges. 

### Poster titles

These should be clear and in very large font (perhaps 60 point or larger) so can be read from a distance, and should be phrased tersely to describe the key points of the study and its outcome. 
Beneath it should be a list of authors and their affiliations in a less prominent size and style.

### Poster summary

Include a copy of the conference abstract if you must (it will be in the conference abstract book) but it is usually best to include on the poster a short summary in font readable from about 2 metres, using curt and easily grasped sentences with simple and concrete aims and conclusions.

### Poster introduction

This should be brief, large font and short sentences. 
It should state the nature of the problem addressed by your project, the broad sweep of current knowledge in the area and how you tackled it. 

### Materials and methods

No-one will read this unless they are really interested (or it is a methods poster), so write this as you wish but don’t put it somewhere prominent that distracts from your more important poster elements.

### Data and analysis 

A poster needs to be visual and with an appealing layout and handsome looking Results figures. 
Results should not be principally in text form, but graphs, simple tables, diagrams and images which are easy to digest. 
These should be well labelled, with legends on or directly under the images/tables themselves. 
Use colour for emphasis of key data features, and use summary diagrams if appropriate.

### Conclusions and summary of results

Ideally use large text font and present as short, concrete dot points. 

### References

Keep these to absolute minimum in small text tucked away at the bottom since very few will need this information, but it is good to form a habit of referencing supporting literature.

### Poster structure

The rule is to keep everything short (if in doubt, leave it out) and visually uncluttered. 
Keep the poster simple and easy to scan, and remember most attention will be on the upper part of the poster, so put boring details (e.g., Methods and Acknowledgements) low down. 
If you want to divide the poster into columns make it obviously so. It is often useful to group related materials in panels of subdivisions. 

### Discussing the poster

You will be asked about your poster (which is what you want) so take some time to prepare answers to simple questions and think about how to respond to a request from a viewer to “take me through the poster”.  
It is an opportunity to shine even if you have to keep repeating yourself to different people.

### Conference etiquette

Stand by the poster (if possible) when conference organisers indicate, so those interested to do so can find you. 
This does, however, limit the time you can spend looking at other posters, so either arrange for a co-author to help or do not stray too far away. 
Ask those loitering at your poster if they would like you to explain the work to them, but do not hector. 
Never photograph other people’s posters without explicit permission as their work is probably unpublished.

## Conference oral presentations

An oral presentation can take several forms but here we consider the short abstract presentation. 

A conference oral presentation is quite a different beast to an invited seminar, where a presenter holds forth on their subject of expertise for half an hour or more. It is usually chosen from among the best ranked abstracts and involves present a piece of research work in 5 to 15 minutes, depending on the session. The shorter the presentation the harder to prepare; it is far harder to prepare than a long seminar as studies always contain complexities not easy to describe in a brief way and there may be several important study stages to describe. They are thus information dense, so must be highly structured with easily grasped slides and clear wording well-honed beforehand to ensure a good and confident flow.

When preparing, remember how often you suffered listening to presentations that were boring with rapid-fire speech and slides that were impossible to read. Resolve to do better.

### General principles

The first principle is that to know your audience and their level of understanding, and treat them with courtesy and respect. No matter how clever individuals in the audience may be, you are trying to communicate rapidly a lot of complex information. Therefore, you need to make it mentally easy for the audience to follow: use unrushed speech patterns, theme repetition, consistent colouring schemes and uncluttered slides. Remember how fleeting your words and slides are to them, unlike printed text and images where a reader can linger or revisit difficult points, so prepare the talk with this in mind.

### Title slide

This is useful to include at the start but the chairperson will usually state the title and authors so the presenter can just move on from the title slide without further comment.

### The first sentence

It is crucial to get the first sentence right, so pick a short sentence easy to say (and remember), so after that everything should go well. Ideally, it is engaging enough to grab the attention of the audience.

### Introduce the work

Concisely summarise the subject and outline the research question and why it is important. You may also want to include formal hypotheses, but it depends on the presentation. 

### Speak … very … slowly

To present well you should not speak fast, which makes a talk hard to follow. It also sounds nervous. Speeding up unconsciously as a talk goes on is common, so it is useful to pause at important slides and start again slowly.  A slow, measured pace sounds nice and confident, speeding up for less important points and slowing down to emphasis. It may feel like talking to a slightly dim child but, surprisingly, it will not seem that way to the audience. Speak into the microphone (harder than it sounds) and project ENTHUSIASM!!! Or fake enthusiasm, your choice, but it helps the audience engage with your work. 

### Laser pointers and presentation equipment

Use laser pointers sparingly and do not wave it around. Familiarise yourself with slide control and laser pointer beforehand, and check slides with animation or movies run on the conference system.

### Slide qualities

Do not use too many slides - an average of 40 seconds per slide is often reasonable. Graphs, tables and images must be easy to read quickly, with large (>16 point) bold fonts and short labels. Titles should be short and informative. Use fly-ins to help emphasise points, but most other animations distract. Blocks of text are best not to go beyond 2 lines or they will be hard to follow. Do not overburden the slide with information and omit irrelevant features that will add to visual confusion; e.g., do not put many literature references in as they clutter and are not easy for audience members to look up. When speaking over text do not read it droningly, but slightly paraphrase in a conversational way. Use colour schemes to help comprehension so, for example, if controls are green on one slide make them green on others. The audience has a brief time to take in a lot – make it easy on them.

### Graphs

It is best to step an audience through the graph from left to right and explain major features as you go. Make x-axis categories match later slides (where relevant), so are easier to follow.

### Summaries and conclusions

At the end of a talk, run through a text or diagramatic summary which reflects the content of the talk but keep it short. Conclusions should be exactly that, and not just repeating a summary; be clear how it relates to the evidence presented in the talk. 

### Acknowledgements slide

Always include one of these. It will mention funding and other support and collaborators, but (unlike seminars) thanking your co-authors is unnecessary as, implicitly, you are speaking on their behalf.

### Practice

After working out the words and slide content, practice many, many times. If you do this you will remember your words as you present and it will flow nicely, but it is usually not best to memorise a script as it is hard to pick up the thread again if you stall. Use notes as a backup and to provide reassurance in case you dry up. When practicing, note the places where you stall, and alter slide or the phrasing prevent stalling on the day.

### Questions

Take this seriously, and get people to pitch hard and soft practice questions to you to guage your response. Prepare for defending particular flaws that you know exist in the talk, but remember many questions will be simpler than you imagine and some will be completely unexpected. If you are a student it is reasonable for your supervisor (if present) to step in to deal with a tricky question or one that needs a lot of background knowledge. If you do not know the answer to a question you should say so (don’t just wing it), but try and provide a little more comment than simply “I don’t know”.

### Fear and stage fright

This is unavoidable if you are inexperienced, but having lots of practice helps inspire some confidence. Beyond that it must simply be endured, be consoled that it will get easier with practice. However, it is important to be aware that the audience almost certainly knows much less about the topic than you do. If the rows of faces seem intimidating, focus on one or two people in the audience can help. Some say it helps to imagine the audience with funny hats or something else distracting, which is questionable, but use whatever you find is helpful.

## Giving presentations and lectures – general considerations

It is a normal and expected skill for a surgeon or clinician to be able to give an extended presentation at a conference or seminar. A lot of presentations are not that great, or are actually hard to understand, so if your presentation is good and clear it will stand out. Good lecturing is a skill that needs to be nurtured and continually improved, and it is rare for anyone to do it well all the time. It is not simple to pin down why a presentation is easy or difficult for an audience to understand since many elements need to work together. Common culprits in poor lectures are slide complexity, unintelligibility of the talk structure or narrative, poor speaking clarity and too much knowledge assumed of the poor audience. Bear in mind that, no matter how impenetrable the presentation there are often audience members with impressive concentration, experience and intellect that ask cogent questions at the end, but that does not mean the presentation went well.

It is useful to recall that a lecture or speech is linear: there is an utterance and a slide projected, then they are gone. The audience cannot easily go back and check something as they can with a written text. The audience must struggle on. However, information is not linear, so lectures employ a number of devices to improve understanding. One is to use a familiar structure, so the audience is introduced to information in an accustomed sequence that is and easily grasped, with the importance of particular elements clear. Repetition helps. Focussing on a small number of points (usually three) is effective. Rhetorical skill and clear diction are needed. Repetition helps. At the end is a summary, and after that the audience can ask for clarifications. This approaches should maximise information transfer. Also, repetition helps.

### You

Dress as convention dictates so you are not a visual distraction. Speak in measured and modulated tones, not monotone, and don’t say ‘um’ more than a few times. Speak unnaturally slowly, but speed up now and again. Smile as much as is consistent with an appearance of sanity, and above all sound interested and enthusiastic about your material. Enthusiasm makes a surprising difference.

The attention of the audience should be between the slides and the speaker. Use the slides to present your concise points and your voice to elaborate. 

### Practice, and the surprising difference between the written and spoken word

The above considerations mean that the talk needs to be practiced a lot, and feedback obtained from others. This practice needs to be repeated until you recall everything easily and sound confident. Hopefully others will tell you where you fall short. Alternatively, record yourself, then listen and all will be revealed. However, when stringing sentences together you may be surprised at how a sentence or phrase seems fine on the page but sound terrible and stilted when utter aloud. In most case it is just that written convention we are used to do not match well with natural speech patterns. In any case, be wary of giving a talk without practicing it out loud at least once.

### Slide clarity

Slides have two functions –as a visual aid and to present specific data. It is hard to get sound advice about how to make good slides, except directly from a mentor, but there are some easy points to remember. Slides need big font size to be read easily from a distance. They should be uncluttered, with information content that is not too dense because the audience has limited time to absorb it. Graphs should be easy to interpret, with minimal complexity and as little text as possible. Summary diagrams and simple visuals can help a lot. Do not use big blocks of text longer than 2 short lines, and use dot points. These and other simple considerations are so often disregarded that just adhering to them can make a presentation stand out. In general, having good slides always involves showing them to other informed and opinionated people.

### Ask other people

Good presentations take a lot of work to get right. Only experience will make things better, but experience takes time. It is far quicker to survey other people their opinion of your talk. Ask a variety people and listen carefully, especially to how well they interpret your slides. If they can’t understand parts of your talk you absolutely must rethink those parts and how you present them. Also, be patient with them and check that they really did understand, and are not being polite, or are misunderstanding important points. This process can be bruising for the ego, but must be done because you know so much more than your audience that it is hard to put yourself in their place.

### The audience

What will the audience expect from your talk? Why are you addressing them? What knowledge can you assume they have? How will they vary in their knowledge background? These are issues that must be clear for the speaker. It is not a good idea to launch into a deep jargon-filled technical explanation without introducing the subject (and the jargon) carefully to the audience: eyes will glaze over for sure. 

### Get your opening lines right.

Very important. 

### Explaining things

If there are concepts used that are not common knowledge they should be briefly introduced and their importance outlined. Don’t take too long, but explain in as lay terms as possible. Once you have explained your concept in terms that a 12 year old will understand the audience will be with you (unless they are all 11 years old) and you can use that concept freely. There will always be some concept you take for granted that others do not, and it is not always easy to spot those. Again feedback and questions from others will enlighten you about how well you explain things. You will improve with time. 

### Say three things. 

A common and useful guide to is to introduce only three major points in a talk. Nevertheless, detailed technical points should not be shunned. It is often useful to restricted them to an identifiable part of your extended presentation, where those who know they will not understand or care can switch off for a short time, and come back later to focus on your three main points.

### Notes

Avoid using notes if possible, however, notes (and PowerPoint presenter mode text) can help to keep the talk on track. If using notes do not simply read them verbatim – they will sound terrible. 

### Using quotes and epithets

It is often a good idea to use interesting quotes, light anecdotes and the occasional curious observation in a talk. It allows a little relief and punctuates the lecture, especially if it is getting a bit dry. Invite interjections if you can, as that serves the same purpose and can help make sure the audience is with you and thinking, or at least awake.

### Be merciful to your audience

Do not pack much into half hour talk. Don’t make it intense and hard.

## Preparing slides for an oral presentation 

A good slide presentation that is clear and easy to understand, making points that hold the audience attention always makes a favourable impression. Using well designed slides is central to making that impact, yet many presenters take too little time thinking through and designing on their slides. Inexperienced presenters can also be very defensive about their bad slides when developing them since, presumably, the slides are clear to them and they put a lot of work into them. Most people in the audience will be kind about bad slides (especially if the presenter is clearly inexperienced) and even experienced presenters use some shockers on occasion.  

Slide presentations are an exercise in efficient transfer of highly condensed and complex information from presenter to audience members. Achieving this transfer involves a very different set of skills to those needed to write a manuscripts or lead tutorial. With that in mind, below are a few points to consider.

### Avoid clutter

The audience has a very short time to decode what the slide is saying, and having too much dense information will impede that. The eye needs to be drawn to points of interest that can easily be understood. Related to this…

### Don’t use big blocks of text

Reading a lot of text while someone is talking is tricky. Reading a big block of text while the presenter is reading it out is not tricky but is not the most effective use of time. Text on slides need to be digested easily and quickly, so the text has to be broken down into smaller blocks that are visually easy to gasp. Often short dot points are good. 

### Text size should be large and bold font

Large text is easy to read.  18 point font often works well, with larger for titles. Using a sans serif font like Aria looks good for projections, but whatever is used should be consistently throughout. Don’t use shadowing on fonts as a rule, as they can look confusing at a distance and underlining similarly is less effective than on the page.

### Make the presentation highly structured

Presentations should be predictable, broken down into easily understood sections on slides with similar style and layout. Information presented across several one slides should use similar colouring conventions to allow cross comparisons.

### Don’t try to make a lot of points

With one slide it is usually best to make one main point or present one set of data, unless the slide is a summary slide.

### Be careful with data tables

Data tables can be hard to read at a distance if large and can be hard to follow if visually complex. The technique here is not to put everything on screen in tiny writing and talk vaguely over it. Few people will follow it if they have not seen that data before. 

Minimise the amount of data presented if possible, and make its structure simple. Use colour and bold judiciously to emphasise particular data point and use fly-ins (if using PowerPoint or similar package) in sequence to highlight points judiciously as they are mentioned. The technique is to step through the data in a structured way which helps the audience understand and read the data. First introduce the data and what it represents (with an informative title above), describe the data categories then mention salient features and important points. It is hard takes in a data tables quickly without guidance from the speaker. 

### Be even more careful with graphs

As with data tables use colour, bolding and occasional fly-ins to delineate the major points of interest in the graph and step through the data in a highly structured way. Make sure that text is highly legible at a distance.

### Avoid excessive referencing

Referencing work is a good habit, but it can be distracting and the audience cannot easily check it in a talk.  The best approach is a simple reference at the bottom of the slide. 

### Use pictures and images where possible.

In a multimedia presentation it is much easier to use illustrative pictures rather than blocks of text, so they should be used liberally. Put any text close to the image it refers to. It helps the speaker remember what to say if the slides are distinctive. Having too many images is usually referred to as having a ‘busy’ slide and that is never a compliment.

### Length of talk

As a rule the longer the talk the easier it is to do it. Short talks have to leave out a lot and compress the information they are communicating. Long talks don’t, so they don’t need to be as carefully structured.

### Use colour carefully

Make sure that colours contrast well and are highly visible on the screen. It is often a good idea to check this before the talk as a test with a projectors. Avoid garish colours unless impact is needed, and then don’t overdo it and bombard the audience till they flinch. Dark text or shapes on neutral light background works well. Flashing or spiralling colours should not be used as they are very distracting in a talk. When presenting a theme across several slides it is best to use the same colours – e.g., if survival rates of group A are red and group B blue on one slide, use the same colours for group A and group B data on other slides. This makes the data much easier to follow.

### Check grammar and spelling

It is strange how easy it is to miss mistakes when the text is large..

### Don’t put in too many slides

Too many slides for a fixed length talk means too much rapid talking. Since talking needs to be slow and measured, that is bad. A rule of thumb is one slide per 40-60 seconds, but it depends on the slides and their complexity.

### Practice the talk

Always a good idea to do this.  Check the presentation works well, especially any inserted films.

### Show your slides to someone else

Present the talk, or at least the slides to someone else as you prepare. There is so much that we do not see in our own work it needs the perspective of another person.  If you remember nothing else, remember this.
