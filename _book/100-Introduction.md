The articles in this collection are intended to provide guidance for less experienced researchers that are contemplating starting (or participate in) a research project. This slim volume cannot provide a detailed instruction manual for designing research projects, rather it aims to provide guidance on really important points where things often go wrong, in areas where there often is no guidance aside from experienced mentors, and on some background subjects that underlie the thinking behind research design. A better summary description of the articles would be that they provide (we hope) concise answers to questions that we at the SERT Institute were asking when we na√Øvely started out as researchers, as well as questions we did not ask back then but should have. 

This work is formed from short articles or vignettes that address a specific topic or question in a fairly condensed form. We aim to provide an informative picture for each topic so the articles average about a thousand words (the customary text equivalent of a picture) which is short enough to scan quickly.  While it is chiefly aimed at surgeons, surgical students and physicians in related disciplines, the themes and practicalities of doing any kind of research are common to many disciplines, we hope it is of wider interest.

One of the main aims of the RNSH SERT Institute is to provide support to surgeons undertaking continuing education, research, training and other academic activities. Surgeons are always time-poor and stressed running busy schedules but love their craft and are highly motivated to improve it, and so achieve better outcomes for their patients. It is very important to undertake high quality and robust research that demonstrate how to improve patient care, just as research done by previous generations of surgeons and medical researchers created the treatments in use now. Such research has another severely practical use: that of training young surgeons in scientific methods, since evidence-based healthcare has over a very long time proven clearly superior to evidence-free healthcare.  In this small contribution to promoting such advances, we must gratefully acknowledge the great help, advice and critiques provided by staff and colleagues at the Division of Surgery and Anaesthesia in Royal North Shore Hospital, St Leonards, NSW, Australia.
